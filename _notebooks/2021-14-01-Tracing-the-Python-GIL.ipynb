    "# Why the GIL matters\n",
    "There are plenty of articles explaining why the Python GIL (The Global Interpreter Lock) exists[^1], and why it is there. The TLDR version is: the GIL prevents multithreaded pure Python code from using multiple CPU cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in [Vaex](https://vaex.io) we execute most of the CPU intensive parts in C (C++) code, where we release the GIL. This is a common practice in high-performance Python libraries, where Python acts merely as a high-level glue.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the GIL needs to be released explicitly, and this is the responsibility of the programmer and might be forgotten, leading to suboptimal use of your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recently had this issue in [Vaex](https://github.com/vaexio/vaex/pull/1114) where I simply forgot to release the GIL and found a similar issue in [Apache Arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/7756)[^2].\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, when running on 64 cores, I sometimes see a performance in Vaex that I am not happy with. It might be using 4000% CPU, instead of 6400% CPU, which is something I am not happy with. Instead of blindly pulling some levers to inspect the effect, I want to understand what is happening, and if the GIL is the problem, why, and where is it holding Vaex down. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[^1]: I am assuming CPython.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^2]: Apache Arrow is a dependency of Vaex, so anytime the GIL is not released in Arrow, we (and others) suffer a performance hit."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Using perf, we can detect process/thread states which gives us an idea which thread/process has the GIL in Python. Using stacktraces, we can find out if the sleeping states are really due to the GIL, and not due to `time.sleep` for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining uprobes with perf, we can trace the calling and returning of the `take_gil` and `drop_gil` functions, getting an even better view on the effect of the GIL on your Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `per4m` Python package, is an experimental package to do some of the `perf script` to VizTracer JSON format, and some orchestration tools to make this easier to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "# TLDR\n",
    "\n",
    "If you just want to see where the GIL matters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Run this once:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo yum install perf\n",
    "sudo sysctl kernel.perf_event_paranoid=-1\n",
    "sudo mount -o remount,mode=755 /sys/kernel/debug\n",
    "sudo mount -o remount,mode=755 /sys/kernel/debug/tracing\n",
    "sudo perf probe -f -x `which python` python:take_gil=take_gil\n",
    "sudo perf probe -f -x `which python` python:take_gil=take_gil%return\n",
    "sudo perf probe -f -x `which python` python:drop_gil=drop_gil\n",
    "sudo perf probe -f -x `which python` python:drop_gil=drop_gil%return\n",
    "pip install \"viztracer>=0.11.2\" \"per4m>=0.1,<0.2\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example usage:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# module\n",
    "$ giltracer per4m/example2.py\n",
    "# script\n",
    "$ giltracer -m per4m.example2\n",
    "# add thread/process state detection\n",
    "$ giltracer --state-detect -m per4m.example2\n",
    "# without uprobes (in case that fails)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Future plans\n",
    "I wish I did not have to develop these tools, and hope I inspire other to build better tooling, that will deprecate mine. I want to write high-performance code, and focus on that.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I do see some options that I plan to write about in the future:\n",
    " * Expose hardware performance counter in VizTracer, to see for instance cache misses, or CPU stalling.\n",
    " * Inject Python stacktraces into perf stacktraces, so we can combine them with tools from http://www.brendangregg.com/ .e.g. http://www.brendangregg.com/offcpuanalysis.html\n",
    " * Repeat the same exercise using dtrace for usage under MacOS.\n",
    " * Automatically detect which C function does *not* release the GIL (basically autodetect https://github.com/vaexio/vaex/pull/1114 https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/7756 )\n",
    " * Apply these to more issues, like in https://github.com/h5py/h5py/issues/1516\n",
